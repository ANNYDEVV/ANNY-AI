Key Features
Structured Logging:

Timestamp: Each log entry has a timestamp for tracing events.
Component: Identifies which module (e.g., ai_evaluation, trading_logic) generated the log.
Severity Level: Uses levels like INFO, ERROR, and DEBUG for prioritization.
Message: Describes the log event.
Coverage:

Application lifecycle events (start, shutdown).
AI evaluations and trading actions.
Staking, reward distribution, and community engagement.
Errors, such as API issues or transaction failures.
How to Populate app.log
Logs are automatically written when the application runs.
Ensure logging is set up using logging_config.py in your project.
Integrate logging calls (logging.info, logging.error, etc.) in all key functions of your modules.

How Archived Logs Are Generated
Log Rotation:

Implemented using a logging library (e.g., Pythonâ€™s logging.handlers.RotatingFileHandler).
Automatically moves old logs to the rotated/ directory when they reach a size or time threshold.
Retention Policy:

Keep a set number of archives (e.g., 7 days of logs).
Automatically delete the oldest logs to save storage.

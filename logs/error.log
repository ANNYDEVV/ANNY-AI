How to Populate error.log
Configure Logging:

Ensure that the logging_config.py file directs error-level logs to error.log.
Example:
python
Copy code
error_handler = logging.FileHandler('logs/error.log')
error_handler.setLevel(logging.ERROR)
logging.getLogger().addHandler(error_handler)
Integrate Logging:

Include logging.error in try-except blocks for error handling in all modules.
Monitor Regularly:

Periodically review the error.log file to identify and resolve recurring issues.
